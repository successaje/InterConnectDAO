# InterConnectDAO Tokenomics

## Introduction

The InterConnectDAO tokenomics model is designed to incentivize active participation, reward contributions, and facilitate decentralized decision-making within the platform. The native governance token is referred to as ICDAO.

## Token Distribution

### Initial Distribution

- **Founders and Team:** 15% of total supply
- **Community Development Fund:** 10% of total supply
- **Rewards Pool:** 15% of total supply
- **Public Sale:** 40% of total supply
- **Strategic Partnerships:** 10% of total supply
- **Ecosystem Reserves:** 10% of total supply

### Continuous Distribution

- **Proposal Submissions:** Participants receive tokens for submitting proposals.
- **Voting on Proposals:** Participants earn tokens for actively participating in voting.
- **Active Contributors:** Ongoing rewards for contributors based on their level of activity and impact on the DAO.

## Token Utility

- **Membership:** Holding a minimum number of ICDAO tokens grants membership status, allowing users and organizations to submit proposals and participate in voting.
- **Voting Power:** The number of tokens held determines the weight of the vote in governance decisions.
- **Rewards:** Active participants and contributors are eligible to receive additional EG-DAO tokens as rewards.
- **Governance Control:** Token holders collectively govern the DAO, influencing decisions and shaping the direction of the academic community.

## Governance

- **Voting Mechanism:** Decisions are made through a transparent and secure on-chain voting mechanism.
- **Proposal Approval:** Proposals require a minimum threshold of approval votes to be implemented.
- **Token Staking:** Token holders can stake their tokens to signal support for specific proposals.

## Future Developments

As the InterConnect DAO evolves, additional features and improvements to the tokenomics model may be introduced. Community feedback and engagement play a crucial role in shaping the future of the tokenomics.
